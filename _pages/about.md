I am currently working towards my PhD degree at the Institute of Network Science and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Zeqi Lai. My research interests focus on satellite networks, space edge computing and network security.
I received my MS degree from Tsinghua University (Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. Qian Wu) in 2022 and BE degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019.
My works are published at conferences or journals such as IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE TMC, IEEE ICNP, USENIX NSDI, and ACM HotNets.
